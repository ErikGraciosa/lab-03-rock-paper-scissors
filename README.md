# lab-03-rock-paper-scissors

## html planning
- rules section as a list
- radio buttons (3) for selection of rock/paper/scissors, use same grouping 
- a button for playing the game
- display win/loss/draw history (static text(3) with spans(3))
- display the result of each game with text and image, indicating computer selection and win/loss/draw


## logic planning
function getRandomThrow()
    - must generate a random number and output a rock, paper or scissors.
function didUserWin(player, computer)
    -input is user's choice and computer generation, output is win, lose, draw
    -need to test the nine possible outcomes
    -assume valid input(rock, paper, scissors)

the game will play when the button is clicked
    -displays result (win/lose/draw)
    -and counts wins/losses/draws

stretch: reset button
stretch: keep track of and display how many times the reset button was hit
